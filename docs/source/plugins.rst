`Email us! <mailto:jmaggio14@gmail.com>`_ We can talk about hosting your
documentation on this site! Or we'll just link to your official documentation.

.. WARNING:
.. ~~~~~~~~
.. Many ImagePypelines users will require your Pipelines and Blocks to be
.. picklable and unpickable. This is critical for core functionality such as
.. server deployment and saving to disk. Please keep this in mind, especially if
.. your blocks use tools like `tensorflow`
