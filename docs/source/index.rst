Welcome to imagepypelines's documentation!
==========================================


The `imagepypelines` package consists of high level tools which simplify the
construction of complex image processing, computer vision, and machine learning
frameworks. During our time in the undergrad Imaging Science program at the
Rochester Institute of Technology, we found ourselves writing and rewriting
code for things as simple as data type casting and displaying imagery when
debugging, causing more trouble than mathematical or logical bugs themselves!
Our hope is that the plug-and-play, easily-customizable nature of
`imagepypelines` will allow all data-driven scientists to construct complex
frameworks quickly for prototyping applications,
and serve as a valuable educational tool for those interested in learning
traditionally tough subject matter in a friendly environment!
