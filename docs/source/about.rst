Origin Story
============

The ImagePypelines package consists of high level tools which simplify the
construction of complex image processing, computer vision, and machine learning
frameworks. During our time in the undergrad Imaging Science program at the
Rochester Institute of Technology, we found ourselves writing and rewriting code
for things as simple as data type casting and displaying imagery when debugging,
causing more trouble than mathematical or logical bugs themselves! Our hope is
that the plug-and-play, easily-customizable nature of ImagePypelines will
allow all data-driven scientists to construct complex frameworks quickly for
prototyping applications, and serve as a valuable educational tool for those
interested in learning traditionally tough subject matter in a friendly
environment!

To achieve this goal, our development team always adheres to the following 5
core principles:

1. Legos are fun
2. Coding should be fun
3. Therefore coding should be like playing with Legos
4. Imagery is fun, so that will always be our focus
5. We must suffer, lest our users suffer
