class CameraBlock(BatchBlock):
    """block to retrieve imagery from a camera

    This block is meant to serve as a entry point for a pipeline by capturing
    images from a UVC-compatible camera. Unlike most blocks in imsciutils,
    this block will have more outputs than inputs. The number of images that should
    be captured is specified be a single element list: [num]

    if mode is set to 'time', then num will represent the duration of time
    in seconds to capture images for

    if mode is set to 'count', then num will represent the number of images
    to capture regardless of time

    N pics to capture (length=1) --> CameraBlock --> N images (length=N)

    Args:
        device(int,str):
            the file path to the camera, or alternatively the camera's
            numerical device id (on linux, this number is at the end of
            the camera's file path eg: "/dev/video0")
            default is 0.
        fourcc(str):
            the codec used to encode images off the camera. Many UVC
            camera device achieve highest frame rates with MJPG
            default is 'MJPG'.
            see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/medfound/video-fourccs
        mode(str):
            the mode for this block to operate in, either 'count' mode or 'time'
            mode. default is 'count'

    Attributes:
        device(int,str):
