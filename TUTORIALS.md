# imagepypelines tutorials

## building your own pipeline
Pipelines are constructed of `blocks` which are simply objects that take in data,
process it, and output the processed data. Pipelines simply provide a high level
interface to control and apply processing algorithms for your workflows.

![pipeline](https://github.com/jmaggio14/imagepypelines/blob/develop/docs/images/pipeline-example.png "pipeline example")

#### let's create an example fourier transform pipeline
```python
import imagepypelines as iu

loader = iu.ImageLoader() # load in image filenames
grayscale = iu.Color2Gray() # convert images to grayscale
fft = iu.FFT() # create an fft

fft_pipeline = iu.Pipeline([loader,grayscale,fft])

# load in a list of example image filenames
filenames = iu.standard_image_filenames()
# process the data
ffts = fft_pipeline.process(filenames)
```

### Simple Input Output Operations
Most blocks built into `imagepypelines` are made to work with imagery, but pipelines
are equally capable of performing IO output operations

#### loading images, process them, and saving them to disk
Thresholding pipeline, read images off of the disk, perform otsu thresholding,
and then save them to disk
```python
import imagepypelines as iu

standard_image_filenames = iu.standard_image_filenames()

# build blocks for this pipeline
loader = iu.ImageLoader()
otsu = iu.Otsu()
writer = iu.WriterBlock('./output_dir',return_type='filename')

# pipeline construction
pipeline = iu.Pipeline([loader,otsu,writer])

# get filenames of saved thresholded data
processed_filenames = pipeline.process(standard_image_filenames)
```


#### Pulling imagery off of a webcam and injecting it directly into a pipeline
_this is also a good example of how blocks can inject data into a pipeline. A block with a single input can result in N outputs_
```python
import imagepypelines as iu

# let's make a pipeline to talk to a webcam and save them to disk
camera = iu.CameraBlock(device='/dev/video0')
otsu = iu.Otsu()
writer = iu.WriterBlock(output_dir='./output_dir')

# pipeline construction
pipeline = iu.Pipeline(blocks=[camera,otsu,writer])

# run loop until there's a keyboard interrupt
while True:
    pipeline.process([10]) # capture 10 images and save them to disk
```
### Machine Learning Applications
One of the more powerful applications of `imagepypelines` is it's ease of use in
_machine learning_ and _feature engineering_ applications. We can easily build
a simple image classifier that is tailored to your purposes

#### Classification using a neural network
You can tweak this example with your own _image data_ and _hyperparameters_ to make a classifier for your own applications.
_this classifier is available as a builtin Pipeline with fully tweakable hyperparameters as **iu.SimpleImageClassifier**_
```python
import imagepypelines as iu

# ----------------- loading example data ---------------
cifar10 = iu.Cifar10()
train_data, train_labels = cifar10.get_train()
test_data, ground_truth = cifar10.get_test()

# --------------- now we'll build the pipeline ----------------
features = iu.PretrainedNetwork() # image feature block
pca = iu.PCA(256) # principle component analysis block
neural_network = iu.MultilayerPerceptron(neurons=512, num_hidden=2) # neural network block

classifier = iu.Pipeline([features,pca,neural_network])

# -------------- train and predict the classifier ---------------
classifier.train(train_data,train_labels) # train the classifier
predictions = classifier.process(test_data) # test the classifier

# print the accuracy
accuracy = iu.accuracy(predictions,ground_truth)
print('accuracy: {}%'.format(accuracy * 100) )
```

#### Classification using a Support Vector Machine
```python
import imagepypelines as iu

# ----------------- loading example data ---------------
cifar10 = iu.Cifar10()
train_data, train_labels = cifar10.get_train()
test_data, ground_truth = cifar10.get_test()

# --------------- now we'll build the pipeline ----------------
features = iu.PretrainedNetwork() # image feature block
pca = iu.PCA(256) # principle component analysis block
neural_network = iu.LinearSvm() # support vector machine block
# SVMs for linear, rbf, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels are all available

classifier = iu.Pipeline([features,pca,neural_network])

# -------------- train and predict the classifier ---------------
classifier.train(train_data,train_labels) # train the classifier
predictions = classifier.process(test_data) # test the classifier

# print the accuracy
accuracy = iu.accuracy(predictions,ground_truth)
print('accuracy: {}%'.format(accuracy * 100) )
```

#### 10 fold cross-validation using your own dataset
```python
import imagepypelines as iu
# for this example, we'll use the builtin SimpleImageClassifier pipeline,
# to get good results you may have to further customize this example
# or create your own pipeline
pipeline = iu.SimpleImageClassifier()

# --------------- load the filenames of our dataset ---------------
dataset_manager = iu.ml.DatasetManager(k_folds=10)
dataset_manager.load_from_directories(
                                'replace_with_your_own_image_class_directory1/',
                                'replace_with_your_own_image_class_directory2/',
                                'replace_with_your_own_image_class_directory3/')

all_accuracies = []
# testing this classifier 10 times using 10 fold cross-validation
for train_x,train_y,test_x,ground_truth in dataset_manager:
  pipeline.train(train_x,train_y)
  predicted = pipeline.process(test_x)
  all_accuracies.append( iu.accuracy(predicted,ground_truth) * 100 )

# calculating a 95% confidence interval
accuracy, h = iu.confidence_95( all_accuracies )
print("accuracy with 95 CI: {}% +/- {}%".format(accuracy,h))
```
