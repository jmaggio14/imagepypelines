## stuff we'll have to write from scratch
- [ ] multispectral image reading
- [ ] multispectral image writing
- [ ] quick plotting tools
- [ ] blackbody eq
- [ ] stuff to easily bind c code (to load in a DLL or .so)
- [ ] autogenerate file names

### sensor tools???? --- Ryan do you have this stuff?

### machine learning section
- [ ] thundersvm classifer
- [ ] dimensionality reducer - Jeff
- [ ] ORB, SIFT - Jeff
- [ ] Fisher Vectors
- [ ] keras pretrained wrapper
- [ ] load in images into classes (auto-labelling)

### Ryan Senior stuff
- [ ] bag of words stuff

#non-imaging stuff

- [ ] Camera Capture
- [ ] Image Buffer
- [ ] Auto Grapher

## stuff from ipcv (may need to rewrite to optimize)
- [ ] dimensions - Ryan
- [ ] frequency filtering (maybe this is too close to home)
- [ ] histogram enhancement
- [ ] probably some segmentation algorithms
- [ ] affine transforms


#other shit
- [ ] standard test images in a repo
- [ ] MNIST, Lenna, - Jeff
- [ ] standard image wrapper - Jeff


# Image Viewer
- [ ] frame counter - Ryan
- [ ] get ROI - Ryan
- [ ] auto-normalize - Ryan
